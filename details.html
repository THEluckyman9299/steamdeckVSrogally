<h1>Find which one is right for you!</h1>

<div class="content">

  <h2>Emulation?</h2>
  <p>Go for the SteamDeck OLED! The colors pop and the controls are extremely accurate. It can play some systems which Windows struggles to play with, such as PS2 and Xbox 360.</p>

  <h2>Performance (AAA Games)</h2>
  <p>The ROG Ally's powerful chip is fit to run almost any AAA game at a comfortable 30 fps, or modern AAA games at 25-30 fps depending on graphic settings.</p>

  <h2>Have a job?</h2>
  <p>The SteamDeck OLED's sleep feature is perfect for people living busy lives. It's a pick-up and play experience. The SteamDeck OLED doesn't have many updates, especially not in three different applications like the ROG Ally does. No annoying driver updates, software updates. It really is that simple.</p>

  <h2>Long sessions?</h2>
  <p>SteamDeck OLED all the way, with its 50Wh battery life! Delivering 3-8 whole hours of battery life (content dependent).</p>

  <h2>Functionality?</h2>
  <p>The SteamDeck OLED and ROG Ally have a tie on this one. The Ally has access to Windows-only applications and software that many editors, programmers, and gamers use. While the SteamDeck OLED may be limited to coding and games, some Windows software applications aren't available. Just know the SteamDeck OLED's trackpads are way more important than you might think!</p>

  <h2>Major problems…</h2>
  <p>The Deck OLED's major drawback is compatibility. Because it runs Linux, SteamOS, it doesn't have access to every application. The ROG Ally's battery life and SD card overheating issue is a major drawback. The ROG Ally may not be very comfortable. It has back buttons in the shape of triggers, but these disrupt how the console is “meant” to feel. The SteamDeck's looks aren't for everyone; many may prefer the ROG Ally's aggressive look with RGB.</p>
